This is an attempt at making an ASP.net Web application for the game "Rock Paper Scissors".

Right now the player can play as many times as they want by choosing a radio button, while the computer's move is randomly generated at each hand.

===
The GUI is very simple, will add some CSS for later versions.

===
The game logic is tested with nUnit unit tests.
