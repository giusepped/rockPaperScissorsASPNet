Rock Paper Scissors in ASP.net
==============================
This is an attempt at making an ASP.net Web application for the game "Rock Paper Scissors".

===
I have used Xamarin as the IDE.

===
Right now the player can play as many times as they want by choosing a radio button, while the computer's move is randomly generated at each hand.
So far, the player can only play against the computer.

===
The GUI is very simple, will add some CSS for later versions.

===
The game logic is tested with nUnit unit tests which can be viewed in the code.
